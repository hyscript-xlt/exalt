## Motivation
This project aims to get to used making REST/SOAP API by using Java EE 8.

## About
##### NOTE: This project was created for educational purposes and do not intended to be used at the production level.
The project is a simple example of a "Hotel Booking System."
We have Hotels and Customers; every customer can book a hotel room. 
There are no strict checks on requests and responses. The main point of the project is to showcase the way that we can organize our backend using Java EE 8 and TomEE 8.0.6
The project exposes the REST and SOAP endpoints.

## Requirements
To be able to build and deploy the application we need to have
* Aerospike database up and running on **localhost:3000**. 
  In case if you are running DB on different port/host you can configure it in `application.properties`.
* TomEE 8.0.6 server
* Minimum Java 8
